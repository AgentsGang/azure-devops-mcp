# Contributing to ADO MCP Server

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the Azure DevOps MCP Server! There are several ways you can help improve the project, whether by participating in discussions, reporting issues, or submitting code changes.

## Bugs and Feature Requests

Before reporting a new issue, search the existing issues to see if it has already been reported. If it exists, upvote (üëç) it and consider adding a comment with your specific scenarios or requirements. This helps us prioritize issues based on community impact.

If no existing issue matches your concern, feel free to [log a new issue](<repo>_issues). The code owners team will review your submission and either approve, request clarification, or reject it. Once approved, you can proceed with your contribution.

## Creating Issues

When creating an issue:

- **DO** use a descriptive title that clearly identifies the problem or requested feature.
- **DO** provide a detailed description of the issue or feature request.
- **DO** include one or more REST endpoints you wish to integrate with. Refer to the [public REST API documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/azure/devops).

For reference, check out [this example of a well-formed issue](<repo>_issues/41).

## Writing Code

You can contribute code in two ways:

1. **Raise a clear and specific issue** for the team to address. [See demo]()
2. **Open the project in Codespaces** and make your own changes with Copilot's assistance. [See demo]().
