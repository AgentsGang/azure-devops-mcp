## How to contribute

All work on the Azure DevOps MCP Server happens directly on GitHub. Both core team members and external contributors send pull requests which go through the same review process.

Please make sure to review and adhere to our [Code of Conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) when contributing to this project.

If you are interested in fixing issues (or adding functionality) and contributing directly to the code base, check out the [contributions guide](./CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Getting Started

Clone this repository, install the content and add it to your MCP client configuration.

### Prerequisites

- Node20
- MCP client

### Installing

For now this package is installed locally into npm binaries directory.

```pwsh
npm install; npm install -g .
```

## How to use
You can run it either locally or remotely. The package is also available on our internal <Feed> feed under mseng (internal).
Note: When starting the server, remember to update the `mseng` parameter in `mcp.json` to match your organization.

### Remotely 
[![Open in GitHub Codespaces]](update_link)

Use our Github Codespace and [check the demo]()

### Running server from source code 

1. Checkout the repository.
2. Install dependencies using npm:
```pwsh
npm install; npm install -g .
```
If you encounter authentication issues, ensure your npm registry is set to the public registry. You can check and update it with the following commands:
```pwsh
# Check the current registry
npm config get registry

# If not set to npmjs, update it to the public registry
npm config set registry https://registry.npmjs.org/
```
3. Open the **`.vscode/mcp.json`** file
4. Replace the *mseng* value with your organization name (the one used in `https://dev.azure.com/<organization-name>/`).
5. Start your server.
6. In your chat, switch to [Agent Mode](https://code.visualstudio.com/blogs/2025/02/24/introducing-copilot-agent-mode)
7. Click "Add Context" and include all available tools that begin with ado_.

### Runing server from exported package (requires access) 
**Notes**: 
* To access this, you must have access to <FEED>.
* If you wish to connect to this feed, please be aware that it is an internal feed and is not available for external access. You can track updates here: [azure-devops-mcp Issue #114](<public_rempo>).

1. Set registry:
````pwsh
npm config set registry <FEED>
````
2. Install package
````pwsh
npm install @modelcontextprotocol/server-azuredevops@0.1.0 
````
3. Ingest your mcp.json at your `.vscode/`
````json
{
    "servers": {
        "ado": {
            "type": "stdio",
            "command": "npx",
            "args": [
                "-y",
                "@modelcontextprotocol/server-azuredevops",
                "mseng"
            ]
        }
    }
}
````
4. Replace the mseng value with your organization name (the one used in `https://dev.azure.com/<organization-name>/`).
5. Open on `.vscode/mcp.json` 
6. Click on `Run Server`
7. Switch to agent mode in your chat: [Introducing GitHub Copilot agent mode (preview)](https://code.visualstudio.com/blogs/2025/02/24/introducing-copilot-agent-mode?ref=baus-net)
8. Click on 'Add Context' and include the available tools that start with ado_.
9. Ask a question or make a request.

### Troubleshooting

For detailed troubleshooting steps, refer to the [Troubleshooting Guide](./docs/Troubleshooting.md).

### Deployment (CI/CD)

1. **Releases**
   - Release tags are created for stable versions. New versions are released manually after stability is confirmed
   - Same for pipeline, we have a scheduling a scheduled Azure DevOps pipeline builds and publishes the latest stable version to the <FEED> npm feed every Monday. Currently, we are not publishing on scheduled runs though, we publish after stability is confirmed.

2. **Artifact Publishing**
   Artifacts are published to the <FEED> npm feed:
   - Registry: <REGISTRY> (ADO org only)
   - Artifacts include the MCP server package for Azure DevOps.
   - We are in the process of publishing in a new feed which will be exposed internally to Microsoft: [#114](<public_rempo>).

## Access

The MCP server will need to talk to Azure DevOps organization that you chose and use local `az` context to do this.

### Testing individual tools

`echo '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"tools/call","params":{"name":"wit_get_backlog_level_work_items","arguments":{"project":"ggurgul", "team": "ggurgul Team", "backlogLevel": "Feature"}},"id":1}' | npx -y mcp-server-azuredevops buildcanary 2>server.log | jq`
